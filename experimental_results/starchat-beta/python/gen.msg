This commit adds support for multiple error bars on the same plot , with the option to skip data points between error bars . This is useful for visualizing uncertainty in multiple measurements , or when two series have overlapping x - axis values and you want to show error bars for each series separately . The syntax for specifying multiple error bars is ` errorevery = ( skip , shift ) ` , where ` skip ` is the number of data points to skip between error bars , and ` shift ` is the index of the data point that marks the start of a new error bar group . For example , ` errorevery = ( 6 , 3 ) ` will add

Use Convolution Aware Initialization for convolutional layers . This can help eradicate the vanishing and exploding gradient problem as well as lead to higher accuracy , lower loss and faster convergence . NB : This can use more VRAM when creating a new model so you may want to lower the batch size for the first run . The batch size can be raised again when reloading the model . Building the model will likely take several minutes as the calculations for this initialization technique are expensive .

This commit adds a new test to ensure that lambda functions are not mangled when used as named aggregation functions .

This commit adds support for chunked dot products for arrays with large sizes , using the BLAS library when possible . This can improve performance for large arrays , especially for arrays with very large sizes . The chunk size is determined based on the size of the array and the maximum size of an integer , to ensure that the BLAS library can handle the largest possible arrays . The code is optimized for performance and uses CBLAS functions when available , to take advantage of optimized BLAS implementations . The code also handles negative strides and other edge cases , to ensure that it works correctly for a wide range of array configurations .

This code change adds support for the % S format code to PyUnicode_FromFormatV ( ) , which allows passing in a Python object that provides a unicode representation , rather than just a raw string .

If no error occurred , the function then increments a pointer to the array of call results , and stores the resulting unicode object in the array .

Fixed typo in azure - pipelines - ci . yml :
This commit adds a ` ` RangeIndex ` ` to the ` ` Int64Index ` ` subclasses to support a memory - saving alternative for common use cases . This has a similar implementation to the Python ` ` range ` ` object ( ` ` xrange ` ` in Python 2 ) , in that it only stores the start , stop , and step values for the index . It will transparently interact with the user API , converting to ` ` Int64Index ` ` if needed .
This commit adds support for ` ` sample_weight ` ` to ` ` RidgeClassifier ` ` , which was previously missing . The implementation is based on the scikit - learn contribution guidelines , and includes tests to ensure correctness and backward compatibility . The commit also includes minor documentation updates and code formatting changes .

The commit message for the above code changes is :
Fixed handling of unicode strings in default_fill_value .
Fixed bug in _quantile_ureduce_func where incorrect results could occur when the input array contained NaNs . The bug was caused by incorrect handling of the case where the input array was sorted and all values were NaNs . In this case , the linear interpolation used to calculate the quantiles could result in NaNs , which were then propagated to the output array . The fix is to use a different interpolation method in this case , which avoids the NaN propagation . The new method is a simple linear interpolation between the two nearest non - NaN values .

fix ( bokehjs ) : add text color to tooltips
Added predict_log_proba method to SVC and NuSVC classes . The method returns the log - probabilities of the sample for each class in the model , where classes are ordered by arithmetical order . The method is based on the predict_proba method , but returns the log of the probabilities instead of the probabilities themselves . The method is intended to provide a more natural interface for probabilistic predictions , as the log - odds are more commonly used in the machine learning literature . The method is only available for SVC and NuSVC models , as they are the only models in scikit - learn that support

This commit adds a new function to the linked list module called kth_to_last . This function takes a head node and a number k as inputs and returns the kth node from the end of the linked list . The implementation is optimized for performance and is based on the concept of a " fast pointer " and a " slow pointer " . The algorithm works by moving the fast pointer k steps ahead of the slow pointer . When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list , the slow pointer will be at the kth node from the end .

Add certificate name and SANs to getcertnames ( # 21444 )
Add rc parameter pdf . inheritcolor , which disables all color - setting operations in the pdf backend . The idea is that you include the resulting file in another program and set the colors ( both stroke and fill color ) there , so you can use the same pdf file for e . g . a paper and a presentation and have them in the surrounding color . You will probably not want to draw figure and axis frames in that case , since they would be filled in the same color . - JKS

This commit adds a new Task class that inherits from the BaseTask class , and sets the default configuration values for the new class . The new class inherits the app , backend , and other configuration values from the current application , but allows these values to be overridden by passing them as keyword arguments to the new class . This allows for more fine - grained control over the configuration of tasks . The new class also sets the accept_magic_kwargs attribute to True , which allows the use of magic arguments when calling tasks .

This commit adds support for specifying a maximum source length when generating text with the ` run_generate . py ` script .

This change adds the create option to the lineinfile module , which allows the user to specify whether or not the module should create the file if it does not exist . The default behavior is to fail if the file does not exist , but with the create option set to yes , the module will create any missing parent directories and create the file . This option is particularly useful when used in combination with the state = present and absent options , as it allows the user to create or remove a file based on the presence of a specific line in a file .

This commit adds support for very large dictionaries by switching to a more memory - efficient representation for the keys . The new implementation uses a combination of 16 - bit , 32 - bit , and 64 - bit integers to store the keys , depending on their size . This allows for dictionaries with up to 2 ^ 64 keys , which is much larger than the previous limit of 2 ^ 31 - 1 . Additionally , the new implementation is faster and uses less memory than the previous implementation .

This commit adds a check to ensure that the Python . h header file exists before attempting to compile code that includes it . This is necessary to prevent compilation errors on systems where Python . h is not present , such as on Alpine Linux .

This commit adds two new functions to the Python / C API : PyObject_AsCharBuffer ( ) and PyObject_AsReadBuffer ( ) . These functions allow Python code to interact with C code that uses the ( character , single segment ) and ( readable , single segment ) buffer interfaces , respectively . The functions are designed to be used in situations where the Python code needs to access data stored in a C data structure that is not directly accessible from Python . The functions are implemented in C and are available to Python code through the Python / C API .

This commit adds support for generating the C API for the multiarray module in a deterministic way , by sorting the functions in the API list in alphabetical order and using the index of the function in the sorted list as its position in the C API . This makes it easier to maintain and update the C API in the future , and ensures that the generated code remains consistent even if the functions in the multiarray module are reordered or added / removed . Additionally , this commit removes a duplicate function from the API list , which was causing a compilation error in some cases .
