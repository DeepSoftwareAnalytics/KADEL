Improved cross - platform compatibility of webdriver - server C + + code . This commit makes the common webdriver - server C + + code more easily cross - platform .

In its place , we now use a custom URL matching algorithm for matching URLs in the WebDriver JSON Wire Protocol .

Additionally , this commit includes an alias for snprintf , which throws buffer overrun warnings when

This commit adds a new test case to IndexShardTests to verify that the post - index operation is executed even if the index operation fails due to an unexpected close of the shard . The test creates a new index , ensures that the index is green , closes the shard , sets the shard state to STARTED , and then attempts to index a document . The post - index operation is registered as a listener , and the test verifies that the post - index operation is executed even if the index operation fails .

" Merge pull request # 5144 from jenkinsci / master
This commit adds support for loading the transport configuration from a file path rather than a classpath location . This allows the configuration to be loaded from a different location , such as a mounted volume , when running the tests in a container . The file path is determined by concatenating the current working directory with the specified path , and the file is opened using a FileInputStream .
