This commit message generator was updated to handle numeric columns with no decimal digits and a precision of up to 80 as longs , and to handle the case where the scale is zero . This is to support a database schema that has numeric columns with no decimal digits , which is not valid according to the SQL standard but is used by some databases . The code also handles the case where a numeric column with no decimal digits and a precision of up to 19 is returned as an integer , which is more efficient .

This code change adds tests for the GVFS repository to ensure that creating a placeholder file while a Git command is running does not fail . The specific test added is ` AllowsPlaceholderCreationWhileGitCommandIsRunning ` , which runs a Git command that is known to allow placeholder creation ( ` check - attr - - stdin - - all ` ) and ensures that the placeholder file is created . It also runs a Git command that is known to block placeholder creation ( ` checkout - index - - stdin ` ) and ensures that the placeholder file is not created .

Merge pull request # 42448 from lpereira / fix - typo - in - xml - doc - comment
Added a new feature to the commit message generator that allows it to generate commit messages for code changes in the csharp repository . The feature works by taking a code change as input and generating a commit message that summarizes the change . The input format for the code change is a diff between two versions of a file in the repository , and the output format is a single sentence that serves as the commit message . The generator uses a set of heuristics to determine the most appropriate message based on the code change . The heuristics are designed to work for a wide range of code changes , but may need to be adjusted for specific cases

This commit message generator was updated to support upgrading the database schema through several versions . The upgrade process is now handled through a set of resource files that contain the SQL statements for each version . The upgrade process is now also able to handle stepping through several versions at once , for example , from version 1 to 8 , by stepping 2 - > 3 - > 4 - > 5 - > 6 - > 7 - > 8 . Additionally , the code was refactored to use a sorted dictionary to store the upgrade scripts , and the resource names were changed to include the version number to make it easier to determine the correct order .
