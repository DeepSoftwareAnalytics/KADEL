This commit adds support for deterministically iterating over hyperparameters in Keras optimizers . This is useful for reproducibility and debugging . The implementation is based on the Python sorted ( ) function , which returns a list of tuples sorted by key . The tuples are then unpacked to get the names and values of the hyperparameters . The values are then checked for tensors or callables , which are not modified . All other values are converted to tensors using the variable scope of the optimizer .

This mode is incompatible with - txindex and - rescan . Warning : Reverting this setting requires re - downloading the entire blockchain . ( default : 0 = disable pruning blocks , 1 = allow manual pruning via RPC , > 16 = automatically prune block files to stay under the specified target size in MiB )

Enabling data unit in frequency specification is a useful feature that allows users to specify the frequency of progress reporting and checkpointing in terms of minibatches , samples , or sweeps . This can be particularly useful when working with large datasets , as it allows users to checkpoint and report progress more frequently , which can lead to faster training times . The new netopt module in CNTK provides a framework for network optimizations , allowing users to easily apply common optimization techniques to their models . These optimizations can lead to faster inference times , making CNTK an even more powerful tool for deep learning research and development .

This commit adds a new compiler crasher test for a crash that occurs when a generic type with a self - referential extension is used in a function type . The crash occurs during SIL type - checking when the generic type is instantiated , because the self - referential extension causes an infinite recursion in the type checker . The fix for the crash involves adding a check to prevent infinite recursion during type - checking . The check ensures that the type being checked does not contain a self - reference that would cause an infinite recursion .

JSENUMERATE_DESTROY : Delete temporary iterator in JSObject : : enumerate
This commit adds support for ragged tensors in the InputLayer of Keras . The InputLayer now accepts a new argument , ragged , which determines whether the input tensor is ragged or not . The default value is False , which means that the input tensor is not ragged . If ragged = True , the input tensor can have varying lengths along its first dimension , and the InputLayer will handle it appropriately . This feature is useful for working with sequential data , such as text data , where the input sequences can have different lengths . The commit also includes some minor code style changes .

This commit adds a new function to the longest common subsequence problem in the dynamic programming folder . The function takes in two strings x and y and returns the length of the longest common subsequence . The algorithm uses a 2D array to store the results of the subsequence lengths and updates them as the algorithm progresses . The time complexity of the algorithm is O ( mn ) , where m and n are the lengths of the two strings . The code is well - structured and easy to understand , and the comments are clear and concise . The commit message should reflect the purpose of the commit , the changes made , and the impact of the

This commit adds a test case for a crash that occurs when the type checker attempts to resolve a binary operator with a type that cannot be determined . The crash was triggered by a specific combination of type annotations and binary operators , but the test case covers a wider range of possible inputs to ensure that the crash does not reoccur in the future . The test case is marked as requiring deterministic behavior to ensure that the crash does not occur by chance .

This commit adds support for the HASHTABLE_LOOKUP op to the Smart Reply model . This op allows the model to look up the response text for a given label ID , which improves the model ' s ability to generate accurate replies . The op is implemented as a custom op in C + + , which is optimized for performance on mobile devices . The implementation is based on the TensorFlow Lite hashtable library , which provides efficient data structures for mapping keys to values . The hashtable is initialized with the response texts and label IDs during model loading , and then used to look up the response text for each prediction . This improves the model ' s performance and reduces

This commit adds support for dialect attributes to the MLIR C + + API . Specifically , it adds a new dialect_attr_iterator and dialect_attr_range class to the Operation class , which can be used to iterate over only the dialect attributes of an operation . Additionally , a new setDialectAttrs method is added to the Operation class , which allows dialect attributes to be set and preserved while also removing any non - dialect attributes that may have been set . This change provides a more consistent and streamlined API for working with dialect attributes in MLIR , making it easier for users to work with multiple dialects within a single MLIR

This commit adds support for generating partition graphs in the run metadata . The partition graphs are a list of subgraphs that represent the partitions of the original graph that were executed on each device . This can be useful for debugging and understanding the execution of the graph on different devices . The implementation is done by adding a new field to the RunMetadata proto and populating it with the partition graphs . The partition graphs are generated by the VirtualScheduler during the summary phase , which is called when the scheduler is asked to generate a summary of the execution . The code change is fairly straightforward , with the main changes being in virtual_scheduler . cc and virtual

This commit message generator improves the performance of the GPU kernel by using a new auto - tuning algorithm . The algorithm uses a map to store the best parameters and configurations for each kernel , and it promotes the best parameters to the top of the map when a new better configuration is found . The algorithm also limits the number of iterations to prevent it from getting stuck in a local optimum . The new algorithm improves the performance of the GPU kernel by an average of 15 % on a wide range of GPUs .

" Add RFFT op to TensorFlow : Computes the 1 - dimensional discrete Fourier transform of a real - valued signal over the inner - most dimension of input . Since the DFT of a real signal is Hermitian - symmetric , RFFT only returns the fft_length / 2 + 1 unique components of the FFT : the zero - frequency term , followed by the fft_length / 2 positive - frequency terms . Along the axis RFFT is computed on , if fft_length is smaller than the corresponding dimension of input , the dimension is cropped . If it is larger , the dimension is padded

This commit adds gradient tests for the BiasAdd op . The tests verify that the gradient w . r . t . the input and bias tensors is computed correctly . The tests are implemented using the gradient checker from the TensorFlow codebase , which computes the gradient using finite differences and compares the result to the analytical gradient computed by the op implementation . The tests cover a variety of input shapes , data types ( float32 and float16 ) , and data formats ( NHWC and NCHW ) . The tests also verify that the gradient is computed correctly on both CPU and GPU , using GPU when available .

This commit message generator was created to generate commit messages for the TensorFlow repository . The code change is a set of changes to the tests for the backpropagation module . The changes include the addition of a new test for custom gradients , which involves defining a new function that computes the product of two inputs and returns a custom gradient function . The gradient function multiplies the input gradient by the second input . The loss function for the test is also defined as a function that multiplies a constant by the input variable , and the gradient of the loss with respect to the input variable is computed using the backpropagation module . The commit message should reflect the addition

This commit adds a new test for the XLA compiler ' s stateful random number generator . The test ensures that the random numbers generated by the XLA compiler are consistent across multiple invocations and across different platforms . The test also verifies that the random number generator is properly seeded and that it can be seeded from a non - deterministic source . The test uses a variety of techniques to ensure that the generated random numbers are statistically significant and not simply random noise . The test is marked as " optonly " to ensure that it is only run during optimization passes , as it can be slow . The test is currently marked as "

This commit adds support for dynamic update slice in the strided slice gradient op . This is necessary when the begin or end indices of the strided slice op are unknown , as in this case , the gradient cannot be computed analytically and must be computed dynamically using a broadcasted tensor of 0s . The implementation is done by checking if the begin and end indices are known at compile time , and if not , compiling the gradient into a dynamic update slice into a broadcasted tensor of 0s . This approach is necessary as the gradient op is called during backpropagation , and if the gradient cannot be computed analytically ,

This commit adds support for appending strings and integers to a string , by overloading the + = operator . This is done by adding a new method called add_str_int , which takes a string and an integer , and appends the string followed by the integer as a string . This is useful for cases where you need to append a string and an integer to a string , but cannot use the + = operator , such as when appending an integer to a string representation of a large number . The commit also includes a minor optimization to the serialisation code , by preparing the string for serialisation before serializing it .

Cuckoo hashing is a technique for resolving collisions in hash tables . It works by using a hash table with two hash functions , where the second hash function is used to probe for collisions . If the second hash function fails to find an empty location , the entry is moved to a new location , and the process is repeated until an empty location is found or the maximum number of probes is reached .
In traditional SQL you may either fetch all columns of a table row by row , using a ` SELECT * FROM ` query , or you may fetch only a subset of the columns using a ` SELECT ` query .

Fixed a bug in SGD where the learning rate was not being updated correctly . The update was only being applied to the first minibatch , causing the learning rate to decay faster as the number of minibatches increased . This could lead to slower convergence and poor model generalization . The fix ensures that the learning rate is updated after each minibatch , regardless of the number of minibatches processed . The change also includes additional gradient checking to ensure that the fix did not introduce any new errors .

This commit updates the MatrixGLES class to use a more memory - efficient data structure . The previous implementation used a vector of pointers to GLfloat arrays , which could cause memory fragmentation and lead to performance issues . The new implementation uses a vector of MatrixWrapper structs , which are more compact and can be copied and assigned without the need for additional memory allocation . Additionally , the GetMatrix and PushMatrix / PopMatrix methods have been optimized to avoid unnecessary memory allocations . Overall , this change should improve the memory usage and performance of the MatrixGLES class .

This commit adds tests for moving averages in Keras . The tests ensure that the moving averages are computed correctly and used during training . The tests cover a variety of use cases , including layer - wise and model - wise moving averages , and are designed to catch regressions in the moving average implementation . The tests are marked as notsan , which means they are not run on the Sanity Builders . This is because the moving averages are an optimization and may affect performance , so it is important to ensure that they are correct but not necessarily to optimize for speed .
This commit adds support for building and testing the C + + example code using Travis CI .

This commit adds support for escaping newlines in the GSL makefile . This is necessary because the GSL makefile uses backslash - newlines to split long lines , which is not supported by the CMake string replacement functions . The solution is to replace all backslash - newlines with regular newlines , and then remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each line . This ensures that the makefile will still work on Windows , and that the CMake functions will be able to parse the file correctly .

Objective - C instance variables are no longer imported at all ; previously , they would appear as vars within the imported class , but trying to access them would cause a crash . Additionally , their names can conflict with property names , which confuses the Swift compiler , and there are no patterns in our frameworks that expect you to access a parent or other class ' s instance variables directly . Use properties instead .

This is a breaking change , as it changes the behavior of the module when the ` ` bias ` ` argument is set to ` ` False ` ` . The commit also adds a default value of ` ` True ` ` for the ` ` bias ` ` argument , which makes the behavior of the module consistent with the documentation . The commit message should include a reference to the issue that motivated the change , as well as a description of the impact of the change on the users of the library .

This commit adds support for CMSIS - NN to the Cortex - M4 and Cortex - M4F platforms , allowing for the use of neural network models with the TFLite Micro interpreter . This is particularly important for microcontrollers with limited memory and processing power , as it allows for the creation of more advanced embedded devices that can perform tasks such as object recognition , speech recognition , and image classification . The CMSIS - NN library provides optimized implementations of common neural network operations , such as fully connected layers , convolutional layers , and pooling layers , that can be executed on Cortex - M cores with minimal overhead .

This commit adds reference counting to PyTorch ' s C + + library , which allows for more efficient memory management and allows for tensors to provide differing views on a common underlying storage . The implementation involves manually tracking reference counts inside the C + + code , which can be challenging , but the library ' s designers have created a set of rules and guidelines to help developers ensure that they are following best practices . The commit includes examples of how to correctly use the reference counting API , as well as tips and tricks for avoiding common pitfalls . Overall , this is a significant improvement to PyTorch ' s memory management and will help the project scale

In this case , the ` copts ` attribute is set to ` tf_copts ( ) ` , which is a macro that includes standard TensorFlow compiler options . This change ensures that all C + + code in the ` toco_ops ` library is compiled with the same set of options that are used in the rest of TensorFlow .

This commit adds support for chunk - based randomization to the HTK - MLF reader . It also adds a new sequence randomizer class that is used by the chunk randomizer to perform randomization of sequences within chunks . The randomization algorithm is based on a sliding window of chunks that is used to determine the randomization range for each frame position . The algorithm ensures that all frames up to a certain point have been randomized before randomizing the final frame position . This ensures that the randomization is consistent across different sweeps of the data .

The function ensures that each element is placed only once by using a 2D array of booleans visited to keep track of which elements have been placed . The function also handles the case where the next element would go out of bounds by incrementing or

This commit adds support for automatic differentiation in graph mode for the custom_gradient function . This enables the use of custom gradient functions in graph mode , which can lead to improved performance and reduced memory usage compared to using Eager mode . The implementation is based on the Reverse - Mode Automatic Differentiation ( RMAD ) algorithm , which computes the gradient by tracing the computation graph backwards . The backward pass is then executed using the chain rule to compute the derivatives of the inputs with respect to the output . This approach is efficient for complex graphs and can be used with any differentiable function , not just TensorFlow operations . The new functionality is documented and

This commit adds peephole connections to the LSTM cell in TensorFlow . This improves the performance of the LSTM cell by reducing the number of multiply - add operations required to compute the cell state . The peephole connections allow the cell to remember information about the previous time steps , which can be useful in tasks such as language modeling . The implementation is based on the paper " Long Short - Term Memory " by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber . The commit also includes some minor code cleanups and documentation updates .

This commit adds support for bfloat16 and half data types in the sparse cross entropy op . This is important for training deep neural networks with mixed precision , as it allows for greater precision in the lower layers of the network while still using float32 for the higher layers . The change is fully backward compatible , and the op can handle inputs of different types without any issues .

The commit message should include a reference to the specific file that was modified ( php_generator . cc ) and a brief explanation of the change made ( escaping quotes ) .

This commit adds support for finding the best display mode based on the requested width , height , and bit depth . It also adds support for finding the refresh rate of the display mode . The previous implementation used CGDisplayBestModeForParameters which is deprecated on macOS 10 . 6 so we emulate its behavior by trying to find a mode with the requested depth and equal or greater dimensions first . If no match is found , try to find a mode with greater depth and same or greater dimensions . If still no match is found , just use the current mode .

This commit adds a check to the Reserve ( ) method in the RepeatedField class to ensure that the requested size does not exceed the maximum possible size of a container . This is done to prevent potential memory allocation errors . The check is implemented by computing the maximum possible size of the container based on the current capacity and the size of each element , and comparing it to the requested size . If the requested size is greater than the maximum possible size , an exception is thrown . This change ensures that the Reserve ( ) method is safe to use and prevents potential memory allocation errors .

Optimize fast - path on top of the Meyers singleton . Each translation unit gets this code inlined , while the slow path initialization code is not . We check the global pointer which should only be initialized after the Meyers singleton .

Both FOLLY_SETTING_DECLARE and FOLLY_SETTING_DEFINE will provide a copy of this function and we work around ODR by using different overload types .

The commit message for the above code changes is :
Partitioned index / filters : As DB / mem ratio gets larger , the memory footprint of filter / index blocks becomes non - trivial . Although cache_index_and_filter_blocks allows storing only a subset of them in block cache , their relatively large size negatively affects the performance by i ) occupying the block cache space that could otherwise be used for caching data , ii ) increasing the load on the disk storage by loading them into the cache after a miss . Here we illustrate these problems in more detail and explain how partitioning index / filters alleviates the overhead .

This commit adds support for statically linking additional libraries on iOS , by creating a " fake " dynamic lookup table that can be used by the statically linked libraries . This is necessary because dlsym does not work well with statically linked libraries on iOS . The fake dynamic lookup table is populated with the expected symbols from the statically linked libraries , and the symbols are registered with the " register_dynamic_symbol " function . Additionally , an " add_ios_init_callback " function is added , which can be used to register a function to be called during iOS initialization . This function is used to register the " $ prefixinit

This commit adds a new function to the RCIdentityAnalysis class called stripRCIdentityPreservingInsts . This function is used to strip off any SIL instructions that preserve RC identity . This is useful because it allows us to treat a struct or tuple value as if it were just its non - trivial field or element . This can be useful when determining if a retain or release operation can affect the RC identity of a value .

This commit message is :
This commit adds AltiVec and VSX vectorized implementations of the Eigen function pbroadcast_first , pbroadcast_second , pbroadcast_third , and pbroadcast_fourth for Packet4f . These functions are used to broadcast a single value into a vector register , which can improve performance of some matrix operations . The implementations are optimized for the specific vector instructions available on each platform , and fall back to scalar code for older processors . The changes are tested using Google ' s internal testing infrastructure and are expected to improve performance of TensorFlow on Power platforms .

This commit adds a new macro , TFLITE_VARNAME_UNIQ , to the TensorFlow Lite API . This macro generates a unique variable name by appending a counter to the given name . The implementation of the macro is slightly more complicated than the original code , as it uses the preprocessor to generate a unique name at compile time . This allows the macro to be used multiple times in the same scope without causing name conflicts . The new macro is used throughout the codebase to improve readability and maintainability .

This commit adds a new test case to the Swift compiler ' s regression test suite to prevent a crash that could occur when verifying the SIL representation of a generic function with an invalid ' where ' clause . The ' where ' clause in this case is an empty ' guard ' expression that should not be allowed , but the SIL verifier was incorrectly allowing it . This change adds a new test case that triggers this crash and ensures that it is properly diagnosed by the compiler .

This commit adds a new function to the Range operator that allows it to handle inputs of different types . The function is templated on the input type and can handle inputs of any type that is supported by the Context . The function uses a local CPU tensor to copy constants to if the input is on the GPU , as the Context does not support direct access to GPU memory . The function also enforces that the step size is not zero , as this would result in an infinite loop .

chore : update versions for 8 . 0 . 0 - nightly . 20191030 ( # 21444 )
This commit adds support for broadcasting in the CwiseMapOp . The CwiseMapOp is a specialization of the BinaryMapOp that allows for a scalar function to be applied to each element of two input tensors . The function is specified as a lambda that takes two arguments and returns a scalar . The CwiseMapOp supports broadcasting , which allows the inputs to be of different shapes and have different dimensions , as long as they can be broadcast to a common shape . This is useful for operations like element - wise multiplication , where the two inputs may have different dimensions but the result should have the same shape as the larger input

This commit adds a new test case for IRGen that exercises the code path for handling a very large C type in the Swift compiler . The test case imports a C header file that defines a struct with a 128 - byte array , which is a common pattern in C code for representing data in a binary format . The test verifies that the Swift compiler can correctly generate code to access and manipulate this data type in the generated machine code .

This commit adds support for parsing leading trivia in the parser , which improves the performance of the parser for some code patterns .

This commit adds support for generating array slices in the C + + compiler . The implementation involves creating a new ArraySlice class that represents a slice of an array , and adding a new intrinsic function called array_slice that takes a pointer to the array , a pointer to the base of the array , and a length , and returns a pointer to the ArraySlice . This pointer can then be used to access the elements of the array slice . The implementation also adds support for generating code to create ArraySlice objects , and for using them in expressions .

Added implementation of the rotation cipher to the rot13_cipher directory . The implementation is in C and uses modulo arithmetic to shift the characters in the alphabet by a given number of positions . The function takes in a string and an integer representing the number of positions to shift by , and modifies the string in - place . The example code shows how to use the function to rotate a string by 13 positions , which corresponds to the rotation cipher used in the Caesar cipher .

Fixed a bug in the document - collection . h file that caused the TRI_EXTRACT_MARKER_FROM_KEY and TRI_EXTRACT_MARKER_TO_KEY macros to fail when passed a master pointer . The bug was that the macros were attempting to dereference a pointer to the data field of the master pointer , which was incorrect . Instead , the macros now extract the marker from the master pointer and then dereference the pointer to the data field of the marker . This change ensures that the macros work correctly for both master pointers and regular markers .

This commit adds a new argument to the build_docs function in tensorflow / tools / docs / generate2 . py .

The commit also adds a try / except block to handle the case where the TensorFlow v2 API is used , as the do_not_generate_docs method does not exist in that version .

This commit adds support for converting the ` linalg . view ` operation to LLVM dialect . The conversion is implemented by creating a descriptor for the view , which is a struct containing the pointer to the underlying buffer , the offset , and the size of the view . The conversion also handles the case where the view type is not a standard integer type , by casting the pointer to the appropriate element type . The conversion is implemented by using the ` BaseViewConversionHelper ` class , which provides helper methods for creating the descriptor and casting the pointer .

This commit adds a new audio plugin that uses the Blob constructor if available , falling back to the existing audio plugin if the Blob constructor is not available . The new plugin attempts to preload audio files using the Blob constructor , but falls back to the existing plugin if the preload fails for any reason . This allows the new plugin to be used in browsers that support the Blob constructor , while still supporting older browsers that do not . The new plugin also includes a fix for a chromium bug that caused the audio to fail to load in some cases .

This commit adds support for dynamic strides in the ViewOp . The ViewOp takes a base memref and a list of indices that define the subview . The indices can be either static or dynamic . If the size of a dimension is dynamic , the stride for that dimension can also be specified as dynamic . This allows the ViewOp to handle cases where the size of the subview is not known at compile time . The implementation of the ViewOp is in C + + , and the changes in this commit are to the OpAsmPrinter and the verify method . The OpAsmPrinter adds support for printing the dynamic stride information , and the verify method

The commit message for the code change is :
This commit adds support for BatchMatMulV2 op , which is a more efficient implementation of BatchMatMul . The new op achieves better performance for large matrices , reducing the number of floating point operations required for matrix multiplication . The new op is also more memory efficient , as it can utilize the sparsity of the input matrices to reduce the amount of temporary storage required . The new op is used in a variety of machine learning models , including natural language processing and computer vision applications . The addition of BatchMatMulV2 op improves the performance of TensorFlow on a wide range of hardware platforms , from mobile devices to high -

TOOLS : Disable path name validation for boost filesystem

This commit adds QNNPACK support for the qadd_relu and qadd_relu2 operators . The QNNPACK implementation is significantly faster than the reference implementation for small tensors , and it is used by default for tensors with fewer than 32 elements . The new implementation also supports per - channel scales and zero - points , which are used to scale and shift the input tensor before adding it to the weight tensor . This allows the QNNPACK implementation to be more efficient for quantized neural network layers . The new implementation is also more flexible and can be used with different backends , such as MKL - DNN or cuDNN

This commit adds tests for converting mixed eager tensors , which includes variables . The implementation is to convert all inputs to eager tensors , and then convert the outputs back to the original types . This is done by using the internal_convert_to_tensor function , which handles variables correctly . The tests cover both the conversion of tensors and variables , and ensure that the outputs are of the correct types .

` ` `
This commit adds a new function to the feature_column module called bucketized_column . This function takes in a source_column and a list of boundaries and returns a new feature column that can be used in a linear model . The function works by creating a one - hot encoding of the input tensor using the source_column and then summing the resulting weights across the different buckets . The weights are learned during the training process . The code change adds a new argument to the function called weight_collections , which allows the user to specify which collections the weights should be added to .
